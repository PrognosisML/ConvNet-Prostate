This project is an open source prototype of an application for Prostate Cancer Carcinoma diagnosis.

There are currently two models, one for four different malignancy levels of prostate cancer: Gleason 3 Non Cribiform, Gleason 4 Cribiform, Gleason 4 Non Cribiform, and Normal Prostate.

The other model for simple cancer and non cancer differentiation.

# Results
---------

- ***For four malignancy levels, the accuracy is 51% compared with a random guess of 25%. ***
- ***For non cancer and cancer diagnosis, the accuracy is 90%.***

ConvNet-Prostate is open sourced for transparency and academia; however, the data used is propietary.
