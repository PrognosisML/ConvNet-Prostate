# ConvNet-Prostate
Neural Networks for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis

This project is an open source prototype of an application for Prostate Cancer Carcinoma diagnosis.

There are currently two models, one for four different malignancy levels of prostate cancer: Gleason 3 Non Cribiform, Gleason 4 Cribiform, Gleason 4 Non Cribiform, and Normal Prostate.

The other model for simple cancer and non cancer differentiation.

# Results
---------

--- ***For four malignancy levels, the accuracy is 51% compared with a random guess of 25%.
--- For non cancer and cancer diagnosis, the accuracy is 90%.***

ConvNet-Prostate is open sourced for transparency and academia; however, the data used is propietary.
